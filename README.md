Scriptster is a small Ruby gem that will help you write scripts in Ruby. It
only consists of two functions and it's especially useful for apps
which depend on many external tools.

This library focuses on these two basic things:
 * Running shell commands
 * Providing nice logs and status messages about what happened

See the examples bellow.

## Usage

```ruby
require 'scriptster'
```

It's not necessary to configure scriptster before using it, if you're happy
with the default settings. But chances are you won't be, in which case the
`configure` method is exactly what you're after. Bellow is a quick example
(for the full list of options, please refer to the
[docs](http://www.rubydoc.info/github/pazdera/scriptster/master/frames)):

```ruby
Scriptster::configure do |conf|
  conf.name = "my-script"
  conf.verbosity = :verbose
  conf.file = nil
  conf.colours = :dark
  conf.log_format = "%{timestamp} %{name} %{type} %{message}"
end
```

The following snippet demonstrates how can you use **scriptster**
in practice:

```ruby
Scriptster::log :info, "Checking branches"

git_cmd = Scriptster::cmd "git branch",
  :show_out => true,
  :show_err => true

branch = "develop"
branch_exists = git_cmd.out.split("\n").grep(/#{branch}/).length > 0
Scriptster::log(:warn, "Branch '#{branch}' not found") unless branch_exists
```

The first `log` method will format and print a status message to stdout.
The latter `cmd` method executes the given `git` command, prints it's
output, but it also keeps it for processing. You will find more about
the options and parameters of these functions in the
[documentation](http://www.rubydoc.info/github/pazdera/scriptster/master/frames).
